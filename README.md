# Pool_42 - 1337 Khoribga

## Overview

Welcome to the **Pool_42 - 1337 Khoribga** repository! This repository contains all the projects and exercises I completed during my time at the **1337 Khoribga** coding pool, which is part of the **42 Network**. The pool is an intensive training program that aims to improve your programming skills, problem-solving abilities, and understanding of computer science fundamentals. Each project is designed to teach key concepts of **C programming** and **algorithm design**.

The **Piscine** (or "pool") is a rigorous and immersive experience, and the work included here spans from the basic introduction to C programming (C00) to more advanced problem-solving and algorithm projects (C09). These projects range from simple exercises like basic variable manipulation and control flow to more complex topics like memory management, recursion, and data structures.
